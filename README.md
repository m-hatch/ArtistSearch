# ArtistSearch

Code Challenge: React iTunes API album search catalog.

## Requirements

1. Create a github Repo or Click 'Fork' from the top menu and generate your own link. 

2. Create a Search Component for entering an Artist.

3. On Search, make an API call to iTunes API to fetch information about the artist.

   `API URL: https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=${ARTIST_NAME}`

4. When the Search button is clicked, make a call to the API and display the list of albums, including the album name and album cover inside #albums-container in a grid. Use any CSS technique you are comfortable with (Note: The API will return a list of albums based on the search result. Use your skills to find out what the iTunes API data structure looks like and extract the relevant data from it).

5. Style the page to the best of your ability to make the UI look clean and presentable.
